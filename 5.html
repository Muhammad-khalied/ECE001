    We haven’t gotten any smarter about how we are coding artificial intelligence, so what changed? <br> It turns out, the fundamental limit of computer storage that was holding us back 30 years ago was no longer a problem. <br> Moore’s Law, which estimates that the memory and speed of computers doubles every year, had finally caught up and in many cases, surpassed our needs. <br> This is precisely how Deep Blue was able to defeat Gary Kasparov in 1997, and how Google’s Alpha Go was able to defeat Chinese Go champion, Ke Jie, only a few months ago. <br> It offers a bit of an explanation to the roller coaster of AI research; we saturate the capabilities of AI to the level of our current computational power (computer storage and processing speed), and then wait for Moore’s Law to catch up again. <br>
