   <br> Based on research from MIT, GPS technology can provide users with accurate, timely, and detailed information to improve safety. The technology uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network and Graph Neural Network, which makes lives easier for users by automatically detecting the number of lanes and road types behind obstructions on the roads. AI is heavily used by Uber and many logistics companies to improve operational efficiency, analyze road traffic, and optimize routes.
</li>
<li><h2>AI in Robotics</h2>

<br> Robotics is another field where artificial intelligence applications are commonly used. Robots powered by AI use real-time updates to sense obstacles in its path and pre-plan its journey instantly. 
<ul> <h3>It can be used for -</h3>
    <li>Carrying goods in hospitals, factories, and warehouses</li>
    <li>Cleaning offices and large equipment</li>
    <li>Inventory management</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> <h2>AI in Human Resource</h2>

<br> Artificial Intelligence helps with blind hiring. Using machine learning software, you can examine applications based on specific parameters. AI drive systems can scan job candidates' profiles, and resumes to provide recruiters an understanding of the talent pool they must choose from.  
</li>
 <li><h2>AI in Agriculture</h2>
<img src="https://mytechpick.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ai-in-farming-1-638.jpg" width="50%" alt="">
<br> Artificial Intelligence is used to identify defects and nutrient deficiencies in the soil. This is done using computer vision, robotics, and machine learning, AI can analyze where weeds are growing. AI bots can help to harvest crops at a higher volume and faster pace than human laborers.
