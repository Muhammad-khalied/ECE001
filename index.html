<h2>What is the artificial intelligence?</h2>

<p style="font-size: x-large;">Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. <br> The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. <br>


  The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. <br> A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. <br> Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.</p>
